Option A: Use the emoji panel (easiest)
Put your cursor inside the Python string in VS Code / your IDE, e.g. icon = ''.
Press Win + . (Windows key + dot).
The emoji panel opens → click the icon you want (snake, game controller, etc.).
It will be inserted between the quotes.
Option B: Copy‑paste
Copy from an existing file (e.g. Lesson 4) or from a website.
Paste directly into the Python string.
Option C: Use Unicode escape codes (without seeing the emoji in source)
python
icon = '\U0001F40D'  # 🐍
icon = '\U0001F3AE'  # 🎮
